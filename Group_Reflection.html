      <h3>Chris</h3>

      <h3>Gerard</h3>
      <h4>What went well?</h4>
      <p>The group dynamic worked well.  All members were active and participated as consistently as they
         could manage.  Meetings were well structured and enjoyable which meant that ideas and solutions
          to problems easy to come by. </p>

      <h4>What could be improved?</h4>
      <p>The organisation of documents, it was sometimes confusing which documents were ‘active’.
        Also, because so many documents were shared and the chat was very active, it was easy to lose
         documents and associated work.  This was somewhat improved with the creation of a separate chat
         where less documents were shared but I am left wondering whether MS Teams was the ideal platform
         for document sharing.</p>

      <h4>At least one thing that was surprising.</h4>
      <p>How the idea for the project grew and adapted.  Of course, each group member had a
         slightly different vision of how both the project idea and the assignment itself should
          end up but the compromise that has been found has, in my opinion at least, turned out well.</p>

      <h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups.</h4>
      <p>In a way, because this group has worked well, I may not have learnt as much about group work as
        I have in the past when things have gone badly.  I think from this experience, the main thing I
        have taken away is that communication is in some ways better when working remotely with a team.
        Notwithstanding my earlier comments about documents getting lost in clutter, when something has
         been said on MS Teams, there is a record of it to refer to.  Also, it meant that should a team
          member miss out on a conversation or a meeting, the other members could refer them to it if needed.</p>
      <h3>Liljana</h3>
      <h4>What went well?</h4>
      <p>In my opinion I believe that as a group we communicated quite well and out meetings always kept us on track and
        understanding what was expected of each of us
        for the next couple of days. Everyone was friendly and always making a conscious effort to be kind. </p>

      <h4>What could be improved?</h4>
      <p>The things that I think we had difficulties with was that sometimes it was hard making sure that everyone was
        available all at the same time when having our meetings
        as we all have life commitments, but we somehow make it work. Also, if someone had to leave early or couldn’t
        make the meeting, they would make a conscious effort to
        catch up on the recordings, so they did not miss out on anything important.</p>

      <h4>At least one thing that was surprising.</h4>
      <p>I found it surprising that even after working on the Drive Aware project idea for a while now we still have so
        many developments, ideas and content to discuss. It does seem
        like a promising App idea and hopefully one day it can be created and used the way we intend it to be.</p>

      <h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups.</h4>
      <p>I have learnt that while working in groups everyone has a voice and we need to allow everyone to be heard and
        to be acknowledged. We need to all make conscious efforts to be kind
        to one another as we are a team and need to cooperate in order to be successful. I am extremely happy with my
        teammates and wish them all the best in their future studies.</p>

      <h3>Matthew</h3>
      <h4>What went well?</h4>
      <p> Our group dynamic has remained positive and focussed. Personally, I have enjoyed working in a group more then
        I thought I was going to. I’ve liked the fact that as a group we’ve had a series of assessments to work on and
        through this time we have gotten to know how each other works and what strengths and opportunities each other
        brings to the group. I believe we have utilised each other’s strengths to successfully complete the required
        work.
      </p>

      <h4>What could be improved?</h4>
      <p>I have felt more rushed to get the last couple of assessment tasks completed, I think that has been a result of
        the larger weekly content requirements and the fact there has been multiple assessments due around the same
        time. From a group prospective, I think we took too much time in making some decisions. In some cases, it took
        us multiple catch ups to make a decision around one area of our project, but I believe this was due to everyone
        wanting to make sure we covered as much as we could in order to submit a thorough body of work. To improve this
        for next time, I think a clear set of guidelines could be created to ensure clarity on the direction a project
        should go. </p>

      <h4>At least one thing that was surprising.</h4>
      <p>I’ve really enjoyed pushing myself mentally and I keep surprising myself on how well I’ve gone in this class
        and also the commitment and ideas that have come with completing this assessment. I’ve also been surprised at
        how enjoyable it has been with working in a group for an extended period of time as it has been something I’ve
        dreaded previously.
      </p>

      <h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups. </h4>

      <p> Working in a group is all about negotiations and working out what is best for the group and not what is best
        for one individual. To be able to come together as a group to complete a common goal takes work but when done
        right it is highly rewarding.
      </p>

      <h3>Nicole</h3>
      <h4>What went well?</h4>
      <p>The fact that we have already worked together in A2, made it a bit easier for co-ordinating meetings because we
        just pretty much kept the same days.
        Every team member is eager and willing to put in the effort so that is definitely a bonus. There is no tension
        in the group, and I believe most feel that they are heard.</p>

      <h4>What could be improved?</h4>
      <p>The content management could definitely have worked better.
        In A2, we all did our own thing and then loaded it up for team review near the end or in bits and pieces. This
        meant it was hard for us to know where everyone was at.
        This time we thought it would be easier to have just one document for all of us to work on.
        In theory, it was a good idea but in reality, not so.
        Editing the document on Teams was a bit harder than we anticipated and therefore we were downloading versions
        and editing those.
        Gerard was the nominated 'reviewer' and had the difficult challenge of trying to establish which version he
        needed to review and edit.
        In the end, we created a new chat called submission and stored 1 group document there.
        I actually think the way we did it in A2 worked better.</p>

      <h4>At least one thing that was surprising.</h4>
      <p>I really enjoyed working on the prototype and I was surprised at how much I remembered from my previous
        subject, User Centred Design.
        I think we managed to create a group with such different skills and abilities that it meant we could create an
        amazing prototype, webpage, video & content document.</p>

      <h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups.</h4>
      <p>To be honest, I found working in a group very challenging. Not because of the people, they were great! I found
        it challenging due to the amount of time we needed to spend
        coordinating the project. Trying to catch up and work on things at time that suits everyone was a bit tricky. I
        also had to learn to step back and leave it to others and wait for them.
        That was a challenge for me but a good lesson to learn.</p>
